# Fixed: Profile Setup Failed Error

## What Was Wrong
When users signed up, they got:
> "Account created but profile setup failed. Please contact support."

## The Fix
Database trigger now auto-creates profiles on signup.

## Run This
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run entire `COMPLETE_FIX.sql` file
3. Test signup with new account

## For Existing Failed Signup
If user email exists but has no profile:
```sql
DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'simran.sahni@ssbainnovations.com';
```
Then have them sign up again.
